# Promos on Blockchain

The idea is inspired by the ongoing situation on gaming market regarding video game consoles. Some sellers introduced a rather complicated way to treat an astonishing demand volumes while having quite limited supply. Sellers randomly choose customers among registered ones that are filtered by some criteria (e.g., an old account that has some video game related purchases on the record), those customers receive a one-time promo code that can be only used offline. In order to make a purchase the customer must visit offline store and pass a two-factor authentication: provide the received code and his passport. That way the seller can verify that the customer is the one who owns the account that the code was sent to.

I'd like to approach the problem from blockchain's point of view, replacing the two-factor auth (promocode + passport) with a private key and a set of smart-contracts, deployed by the seller.
